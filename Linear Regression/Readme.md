This folder contains the code for linear regression implemented from scratch.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 . First a linear regression implented with only one feature with simple mathematical equation.
 2 . Then a improvised linear regression implemented with vector notation.
 3 . Then all the code relted to linear regression tightly packaged into a class.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 My purpose here is to brush up the mathematical significance of Linear Regression and how Gradient Descent 
 works with vector notation. If like my stuff, look at other algorithms i implemented, for that matter other 
 repositories. Fork if you needed.
