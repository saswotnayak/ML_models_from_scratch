Readme To Know About the Folder
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This folder contains the python code for Gaussian Naive Bayes implemented from scratch. 
Code only uses pandas and numpy library to implement the model. Where as i have used scikit-learn 
to compare the performance of my model against the scikit learn.

This is a term project of the course CS561, conducted by Dr. Satyanath Bhat at IIT GOA for winter semester 2020.
You can see course lectures on youtube on Dr. Satyanath Bhats channel.

This folder contains 2 files.
  1. Handwritten Letter Classification.ipynb
     This colab notebook has all the python code. I have used handwritten letters as dataset for my model.
     From data prepping to model building to evaluation of performance all done in this code file.
  2. CS561_project_Report
     As a result of of the project this report has been produced to discuss all nitty gritty of the code.
     You can check out for more indetail working and performance of the model.

If you needed the handwritten letter dataset , Then follow the link to download dataset in zip file 
(file size is of 90 MB).Follow the link - https://1drv.ms/u/s!AneGigPAQg74gZNlJFAeTYWH4lehKw?e=lVcwMI
After you download the data, you can mount it in your Gdrive along with colab and run the code. 
(Disclaimer - You need to change the mounting link while reading the data in colab).
